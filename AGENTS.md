> **2026-06-16 — NBA/NHL off-season:** NBA Finals and Stanley Cup Final are both done. SGO endpoints for NBA and NHL are blocked (HTTP 503). The pipeline no longer calls NBA or NHL — `daily_picks.py`, `pipeline_master.py`, and all 1PM/1:30PM/5PM/6:30PM/2AM automations now run WNBA + MLB + World Cup only. To reactivate when next season starts: ungate `/api/tc` + `/api/dk-lines` for NBA/NHL, restore `["NBA","NHL","WNBA","MLB","WORLD_CUP"]` in `daily_picks.py ALL_SPORTS`, and add NBA/NHL back to all automation sport lists.

> **2026-06-17 — API Registry + Unified Cache System:** `Projects/api_scan.py` probes 12 endpoints (Odds API, SGO, ESPN, SportsDataIO) and writes `Daily_Log/api_registry.json` with scan timestamp, status, latency, free_tier flag, and `last_used_at`. `Projects/api_cache.py` provides `cached_get(name, url, ttl)` — primary read path; disk cache `Daily_Log/cache/api/{name}.json`, default 2-hour TTL, registry auto-bumped on hit. `python3 Projects/api_cache.py warm` pre-populates from registry. Cache hits: ~1ms (vs 50-200ms network). Run scan whenever a new API is added or rate limit issues surface.

> **2026-06-17 — Soccer boxscore capture added:** `Projects/soccer_boxscore_capture.py` captures World Cup final boxscores from ESPN plays API (player-level stats: goals, assists, shots, SOT, cards, fouls, saves, tackles, passes). Basketball (WNBA/NBA) remains in `Projects/boxscore_saver.py`. Both use separate dedup registries (`wc_boxscore_registry.json` vs `boxscore_registry.json`). "Boxscore Capture" automation (8:30/10:30/12:30 PM ET) now runs both scripts.

> **2026-06-17 — WC_NAME_TO_CODE added:** `/api/tc` now maps all 48 Odds API World Cup team names → ESPN 3-letter abbreviations (e.g. "DR Congo" → "COD"). Previously COD@POR showed "NO DK LINES" because `matchOddsTeam` couldn't resolve "DR Congo" — now all 4 active WC games pull DK totals/ML/spreads. `WC_NAME_TO_CODE` lives in `/api/tc` alongside `MLB_NAME_TO_CODE` and `NHL_NAME_TO_CODE`.

> **2026-06-17 — World Cup player props integrated into `/api/tc`:** `buildMultiSportProjection` now loads WC player props from `Daily_Log/worldcup/YYYYMMDD/props.json` (output of `worldcup_picks.py`). For WORLD CUP and SOCCER sports, the function loads the locally-cached props and maps them into roster format. All 3 active WC games (CRO@ENG, PAN@GHA, COL@UZB) now return full player rosters with FanDuel props. `normMultiSport` updated with WC_NAME_TO_CODE support. `/api/worldcup-odds` TEAM_ABBREV replaced with full WC_NAME_TO_CODE (48 teams).

> **2026-06-17 — WNBA prop edge thresholds lowered + internal fallback:** `/api/tc` `PROP_EDGE_FILTERS` was NBA-calibrated (PTS:2.5, REB:2.0, AST:2.0, 3PM:1.0, STL:0.8, BLK:0.8) — WNBA consensus lines are tighter so edges rarely exceeded these. Now split into `PROP_EDGE_FILTERS_NBA` (unchanged) and `PROP_EDGE_FILTERS_WNBA` (PTS:1.5, REB:1.0, AST:1.0, 3PM:0.5, STL:0.5, BLK:0.5) via `getPropFilters(sport)`. Also added self-edge fallback: when Odds API player props are unavailable (quota exhausted), `propRowsForBacktest` uses internal `edge_pts`/`edge_reb`/etc. instead of returning all NO LINE. Result: WNBA combos went from 0 qualified across 6 games → 82 qualified legs.

> **2026-06-17 — Multi-tier API fail-safe deployed (`api_fallback.py`):** When Odds API primary key hits monthly quota, the system auto-detects exhaustion and falls through tiers:
> - **Tier 0:** Disk cache — per-game, daily; zero API calls on re-runs
> - **Tier 1:** SGO (MLB only) — zero Odds API cost; proven working
> - **Tier 2:** `ODDS_API_KEY` (primary, $25/mo) — tried first
> - **Tier 3:** `ODDS_API_KEY_FREE` (free tier, 500 req/mo) — tried when primary exhausted  
> - **Tier 4:** Self-edge — internal TC projections without market verification
> 
> Quota is detected at runtime via 401 `OUT_OF_USAGE_CREDITS` and persisted to `~/.zo/quota.json` for the day. `daily_picks.py` replaced its dual `enrich_player_lines()` + `fetch_consensus_for_matchup()` calls (4 Odds API hits per WNBA game) with a single `FallbackManager.enrich()` call (2 hits via Tier 2/3, cached after). MLB now routes through SGO exclusively. To activate the free tier fallback, add `ODDS_API_KEY_FREE` to `/root/.zo/secrets.env`.
> 
> **Cache:** `~/.zo/odds_cache/YYYY-MM-DD/` — each game cached after first fetch, TTL 2 hours. Re-runs cost zero Odds API calls.

> **2026-06-15 — NBA/NHL gating (now superseded):** `/api/tc` and `/api/dk-lines` were gated to disable NBA + NHL. Pipeline defaults to WNBA/MLB/World Cup. Streamlit dashboard shut down for NBA, services consolidated to WNBA + soccer only.

> **2026-06-17 — Workspace purge + route fix:** Purged ~3MB of obsolete Archives dirs (`_ALL_OBSOLETE_*`, `archive_legacy`, `obsolete_dashboard_dupes`, `reports_legacy`, `root_cleanup_*`, `source_cleanup_*`), duplicate project copies (`backtest/`, `data/`, `nba-tc-workspace/`), and all empty directories. `/api/dk-lines` default sport changed from NBA (off-season → 503) to WNBA. Health checks consolidated: `/api/pipeline-health` is the single canonical health endpoint — old `Scripts/health_check.py` and `Projects/pipeline_health.py` are deprecated fallbacks. Health route now includes combos, World Cup, and WNBA boxscores in its probe set.

> **Run the pipeline:** `python3 Projects/pipeline_master.py` — self-checks, repairs, generates picks/combos for WNBA, MLB, World Cup. Auto-repairs Streamlit + DK Combos + Soccer Combos.
